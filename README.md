# Study__React--Messenger
Just trying to learn React, Python, Flask
[Here's the back-end](https://github.com/developerjaym/Study__Python--Messenger)

## The Basic Idea
It's supposed to look like a clone of Android.
- You can chat with friends
- You can install apps
- You can play some games

## Why?
As mentioned above, this was just a project to help me learn React, Python, and Flask.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
